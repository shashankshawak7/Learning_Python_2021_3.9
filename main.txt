#python
#python is a programming language

question 1.  why python?
                -> easy to learn
                -> scripting+programming(procedural and non procedural)
                -> a vast amount of libraries

    #machine learning and AI
        code is vastly written in python


procedural code:
            step wise code
            1. open a file
            # f= open('file')
            2. read the file
                read=f.read()
            3. write the file
                write=f.write()
            4. close the file
                f.close()
non procedural code:
                functions
                class

-->  prebuilt code for using in any code
library for finding square
def square(x):
    return x*x
import the library in the code
then run the code

import square
square(5)


#versions
2020: you can write code but support is off
    -> 2.1.0
    -> 3.6.0

2021:
